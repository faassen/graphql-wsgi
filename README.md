# graphql_wsgi

Port of [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql)
to Python and WSGI. Uses
[graphql-core](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core).

For a demo of how this can be used to create a GraphQL server (with Relay
support) in Python, see [relaypy](https://github.com/faassen/relaypy).
